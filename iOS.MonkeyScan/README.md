MonkeyScan
==========

Barcode scanning app for [MonkeySpace 2012](http://monkeyspace.org) in Boston; works with the barcodes generated by iOS 6 PassKit as well as the official tickets generated by [guestlistapp.com](http://guestlistapp.com).

It stores all scans and attendees in a local SQLite database, and attempts to sync up with other devices at the same event via Azure Mobile Services. For now this sync'ing is manually triggered and best-effort; some work is required on the error/retry mechanism.

Uses Xamarin's official port of the Windows Azure Mobile Services [client library](http://blog.xamarin.com/2012/09/20/xamarin-partners-with-microsoft-to-support-azure-mobile-services-on-android-and-ios/) for iOS (and Android). You'd need to establish an account on [windows.azure.com](http://windows.azure.com) and create `ConfScan` and `ConfAttendee` tables for this bit to work.

Also has a feature where the scan-data can be saved/exported as a CSV to the iTunes-accessible Documents folder on your device, which you can then download for review/reporting.

Uses [@chknofthescene](http://twitter.com/chknofthescene)'s [port of zxing](https://github.com/chkn/zxing.MonoTouch) for the barcode scanning. There are other [ports available](https://github.com/Redth/ZxingSharp.Mobile) ([@redth](http://twitter.com/redth)).
